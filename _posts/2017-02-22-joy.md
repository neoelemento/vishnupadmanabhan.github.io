Certain sacrifices that we do, are they worth? When do we know that a person is worth more than others whom you know since many years?

Sometimes, we drift away in the delusion. Other times we realise the mistake. But life's lesson's should be learned looking at others too. If you have seen something, if it happens again, it should be an alarm. If not, you are doomed.

Wake up and see the changes.
