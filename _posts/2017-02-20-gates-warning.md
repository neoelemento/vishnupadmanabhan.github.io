Bill Gates made an alarming statement that there is a big chance that a pandemic might just wipe out a population of around 30 million if we aren't prepared for it. It is scary!

Times have changed. Gates says that there is a good chance of this originating from a computer used by a terror organisation.

>The next epidemic could originate on the computer screen of a terrorist intent on using genetic engineering to create a synthetic version of the smallpox virus ... or a super contagious and deadly strain of the flu.

Maybe it is time for governments across the world to focus on what is needed. Knowing this, should we be unprepared?
