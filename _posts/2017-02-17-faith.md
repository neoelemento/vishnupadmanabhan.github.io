It's hard to fathom how mankind can be so blinded by faith. Instead of living life and letting others live, why do we move to violence to try and prove our religion is better over theirs? What is a religion? Do we really need it?

>By all means let's be open-minded, but not so open-minded that our brains drop out. <br>
-Richard Dawkins

The toxic injection of blind belief is being administered to human beings right from the time of birth. Children are taught that belief should not be questioned and that god is ultimate. Logical questions are discouraged.

Why not let them make the choice themselves. Let them learn and make a decision whether they need a god or not in their lives. I am content with believing that I am solely responsible for my life. Let it be for everyone.
