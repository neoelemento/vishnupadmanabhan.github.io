Roles that we play in life are numerous. Considering only adult life, we play the role of being a family person, social person and a professional. To have a happy life, there needs to be a smooth transition between these roles. Sometimes, it requires the maturity of understanding and prioritising what is important.

As with the roles, we maintain various relationships as well. Each of these relatonships have specific expectations from us. Juggling the priorities, we may fail to fulfil these expectations. It is difficult task to ensure that everyday you give your undivided attention to all aspects of your life.

It is hence, very important that we get the people you care for on board with your plans. They need to understand the challenges and difficulties that you might face following your goals. It may even end up straining the relationship. But it should withstand the test of time.

>Life only gives you one chance to live it. So it is important to make the right choices (or at least try).

Also, when you make relationship choices, ensure that it is a constructive relationship. If you are spending more time stitching the wounds of daily fights and arguments, do yourself a favour and walk away. On the other hand, if you are giving and getting space for each other, by all means, hold such relationships close.

It's safe to say that most of the people we know have good intentions. No one is trying to bring any harm on purpose. So trust them. Unless we learn to stop trying to find out negativity in people around us, we cannot be positive.

I spend my time trying to have fun, cracking jokes and being sarcastic. My sarcasm has helped me find real gems amongst people. The ones really care about you, they don't mind if you roast them with sarcasm. Others on the hand are easily offended. I am not talking about being a jerk and irritating people. You just know it as we meet people.

So for me, life is a balance between being with my dear ones, taking care of my work *(it pays bills)* and doing few things I love to do. That gives me peace. That is my life. I love it. You should too!
