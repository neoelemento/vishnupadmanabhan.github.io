I always had a liking for illustration and design. Back during my school days, I tried creating some graphics in what was then the ultimate tool for graphic design - *MS Paint*. Before you frown upon it, take a look at [this](http://www.smosh.com/smosh-pit/photos/ms-paint){:target="_blank"}!. 

Sure, I never made such awesome graphics using Paint, but I was fascinated the way you could digitally create an image. Years later I came across a tool called [Adobe Fireworks](http://www.adobe.com/in/products/fireworks.html){:target="_blank"}. It was from the same family of products as Photoshop and Illustrator, but little less popular I suppose. Sadly it is discontinued now.

I have seen very few designers use Fireworks. But to me, it was everything I needed. It, in fact, was a mixture of Photoshop, which supported editing raster images and Illustrator, used for vector graphics. There were few very good tutorials on YouTube and I learnt how to do some editing.

Later on, I moved on to doing more of coding and slowly lost touch with graphics design. Also around this time I moved to Linux and I couldn't find patience to learn how to use [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/){:target="_blank"} or [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org){:target="_blank"}, the cross-platform raster and vector design tools respectively.

But this week, I tried Inkscape. I have been using windows as my primary desktop for almost three months now. I use banner images on my blog. If it is a custom image, I used [Canva](http://canva.com){:target="_blank"}. It is an online graphics tool which is very simple and easy to use. If it was an image, I would do some editing in [Pixlr Express](pixlr.com/express/){:target="_blank"} and then compress the jpeg image.

But I had been reading about *svg(scalable vector graphics)* lately. The svg image type has a very small file size compared to a *jpeg* or *png* image type. Where a typical compressed *jpeg* can be anywhere from 60-140kb the SVG is around 4-20kb resulting in huge bandwidth savings.

So, I tried using [Gravit](http://gravit.io){:target="_blank"}. It is an online tool similar to Illustrator. It's amazing for a free online editor. Gravit is really great if you want easy to do and less complex illustrations. But I also tried Inkscape again. This time with the help of some online tutorials, especially by [Nick Saporito](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEQXp_fcqwPcqrzNtWJ1w9w){:target="_blank"}, I got back up again. The fiery comet you see on the banner is from one of his tutorials.

So, going forward, I would try to create all illustrations for the blog myself. Add that to *things to do in 2017*!
