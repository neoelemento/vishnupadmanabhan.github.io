During my conversations with my friends and others over religion, I have heard many arguments that are considered to be the reason religion is necessary for human life. One of those arguments was related to morality. Almost everyone argued that the following a religion is the only way morality can be bought into human life. I don't think so.

Sam Harris makes really good points in this TED talk he gave back in 2010.

Watch it and think about it. It makes good sense. I know more than half of the people watching it are going to come back at his throat. But the fact is, science can always answer moral questions. If religious guidelines are based on expectations that human being act in a specific way hence something is important, it does not seem to be a morality lesson.
