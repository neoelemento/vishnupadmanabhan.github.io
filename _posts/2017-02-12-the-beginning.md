So why another website when I am running [neoelemento](http://neoelemento.com) you ask? Well, to be frank, this domain was available, so I thought why not go for it? Who doesn't love a domain name in one's own name?

In fact I am mostly going to use this domain as a personal journal of some sorts. I had a habit of journaling everything many years back when I was in school. But that habit did not follow me to the adulthood. 

Maybe this is a good time for a restart. Though I might not post everyday, I intend to be regular and consistant. This will the thing that will hold me accountable for my actions and thoughts.

Having a journal is fun as well as it is a measurement of your growth over a period of time. My commitment for now is a short one at least on a daily basis. Longer post will be a part of this journal as well. Maybe personal experiences etc. Let's see :wink:
