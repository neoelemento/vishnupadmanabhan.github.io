Breaks are always welcome. Especially when it is with a bunch of people who are fun to hang out with. Last week was amazing. Goa! The dream destination that is closer to home. Three days spent there were mesmerizing.

I will write a long post about the trip. But for three days I didn't feel I was in India. Completely different culture and people. Life is so fat and night is forever young!.
