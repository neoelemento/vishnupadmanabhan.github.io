Turning 30 seems like a big deal. I turned 30 last year. Life doesn't seem to be different. It just felt like another day. I still live like I did during my late 20s. Today we celebrated another 'turning 30'.

My best friend Renjith turned 30 today. There was a whole lot of balloons, roses and cake cutting stuff. Well spent evening watching live music. We had fun cutting cake and clicking photos.

To my question about being nervous or sad about turning 30 he replied:

>"You turned 30 before I did and looking at the way you live life, I am least bothered about my age"

Was one of the best compliments I received lately :wink:
