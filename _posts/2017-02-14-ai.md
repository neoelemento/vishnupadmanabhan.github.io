Billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Elon Musk who has been vocal in his opinion of Artificial Intelligence, was quoted on CNBC:

>“Over time I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence. It’s mostly about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and the digital version of yourself, particularly output.”<br>

More importantly,

>"If you can’t beat the machines, it’s better to become one."

I think it's time we accept that we are perhaps an inferior race created just to facilitate the AI race.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hope we&#39;re not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/496012177103663104">August 3, 2014</a></blockquote>

In any case, I think we did good and served our purpose well. Now that begs the question. If we are the ones who created AI, are we ***Gods*** to them?

Well, answer might be a surprise for us.
