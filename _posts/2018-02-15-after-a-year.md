Its been almost a year since I left coding and also updating this blog. This was supposed to be my _code_ blog. But various things kept me away from actively coding (yeah the regular excuses :wink:). Anyway, I happened to read somewhere that Laravel 5.6 was released, so wanted to see what has changed. 

I have used Laravel since it was in 4.1 state I think sometime back in early 2014 sometime. I had never used a framework till then, but was amazed at the ease of building a web application using this wonderful framework. I was hooked. I was working for a startup company at that time and we launched a few projects in Laravel. It was fun!

Laravel grew really fast into a popular PHP framework. Along with that JavaScript was also undergoing trnsformations.
