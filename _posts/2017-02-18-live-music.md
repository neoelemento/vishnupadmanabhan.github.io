Music is lifeline. Can't live without it. So when there is a chance to hear it live, took it. As always with live music, I wasn't disappointed. This weekend, we wwent to see a band play live.

Watched [Perfect Strangers](https://www.facebook.com/PerfectStrangersIndia/) play live yesterday evening. Awesome tight performance and a great setlist. On of my favourite from the list was Toto's **Hold the line**. Music always is a welcome change after a week's worth of work.

Looking forward to more of such weekend evenings.
