Hello, I am Vishnu and this is my personal tech blog. A site where I chronicle my coding stuff and my personal opinions on tech related stuff. I also have another website which I think of as a professional website - [neoelemento](http://neoelemento.com){:target="_blank"} where I post about general life and productivity tips. I consider this to be my personal website as it is more closely related to my passion - programming.

I have been working in tech industry since I graduated college. Over my career, I have worked with corporates and startup companies being a part of big teams and have led small teams as well. My various roles have given me exposure on ***frontend development, project management*** and ***UI designing***.

My love towards computers started when my dad got me an assembled Pentium 4 PC for getting good grades in my 10th. I started programming in Turbo C++ (yes the same blue background IDE) for my school. I built HTML pages and websites using MicroSoft FrontPage. Since then I was hooked to everything programming.

In my day job I work as a Program Manager for Dell on their Dell.com platform and by night I am a programmer and blogger working on my side projects. Anything I write here is does not reflect the opinion of my employer in any way.
