Hello, I am Vishnu and this is my personal website. A site where I chronicle my thoughts and my personal opinions. I also have another website which I think of as a professional website - [neoelemento](http://neoelemento.com) where I post about programming and general life and productivity tips.

I have been working in tech industry since I graduated college. Over my career, I have worked with corporates and startup companies being a part of big teams and have led small teams as well. My various roles have given me exposure on *frontend development, project management* and *UI designing*.

My love towards computers started when my dad got me an assembled Pentium 4 PC for getting good grades in my 10th. I started programming in Turbo C++ (yes the same blue background IDE) for my school. I built HTML pages and websites using MicroSoft FrontPage. Since then I was hooked to everything programming.
